    "# Kubernetes Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You can complete this tutorial with a partner if you have trouble downloading/installing Docker Desktop or any of the Kubernetes software.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='prereq'></a>\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Docker\n",
    "1. Install `Docker Desktop`. Use one of the links below to download the proper Docker application depending on your operating system. You will need to make an account on `dockerhub`.\n",
    "    1. For Mac users, follow this link- https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/.\n",
    "    2. For Windows users, follow this link- https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/\n",
    "        1. You will need to install Hyper-V to get Docker to work.\n",
    "    3. For Linux users, follow this link- https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/\n",
    "2. Open a Terminal window and type `docker run hello-world` to make sure Docker is installed properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install `kubectl`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the Kubernetes command-line tool, [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/), so that you can communicate with Kubernetes clusters.\n",
    "    1. Follow the instructions in the link to install the proper version depending on your operating system (Linux, MacOS, or Windows). Either versions `v1.16.0` or `v1.17.0` are fine. You can choose to install through a package manager (like Homebrew) or by downloading the binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install AWS CLI version 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Installing the AWS CLI is dependent on your operating system. Please follow the appropriate link below based on your operating system.\n",
    "    1. [Linux](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-linux.html)\n",
    "    2. [macOS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-macos.html)\n",
    "    3. [Windows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-windows.html)\n",
    "2. Please make sure you add the AWS CLI version 1 executable to your command line Path.\n",
    "3. Verify that AWS CLI is installed correctly by running `aws --version`.\n",
    "    1. You should see something similar to `aws-cli/1.17.0 Python/3.7.4 Darwin/18.7.0 botocore/1.14.0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configuring the AWS CLI\n",
    "You need to retrieve AWS credentials that allow your AWS CLI to access AWS resources.\n",
    "1. Sign into the [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) as the *root user*. This simply requires that you sign in with the email and password you used to create your account.\n",
    "2. Choose your account name in the navigation bar at the top right, and then choose **My Security Credentials**.\n",
    "3. Expand the **Access keys (access key ID and secret access key)** section.\n",
    "4. Press **Create New Access Key**.\n",
    "5. Press **Download Key File** to download a CSV file that contains your new *AccessKeyId* and *SecretKey*. Keep this file somewhere where you can find it easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you can configure your AWS CLI with the credentials you just created and downloaded.  \n",
    "6. In your Terminal, run `aws configure`.\n",
    "    1. Enter your *AWS Access Key ID* from the file you downloaded.\n",
    "    2. Enter the *AWS Secret Access Key* from the file.\n",
    "    3. For *Default region name*, enter `us-east-1`. \n",
    "    4. For *Default output format*, enter `json\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. Run `aws s3 ls` in your Terminal. If your AWS CLI is configured correctly, you should see nothing (because you do not have any existing AWS S3 buckets) or if you have created AWS S3 buckets before, they will be listed in your Terminal window.\n",
    "    1. If you get an error, then please try to configure your AWS CLI again.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Install *eksctl*\n",
    "1. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html#w243aac11b7b5b9b7b1) under the \"**Install eksctl**\" section to install *eksctl* depending on your operating system.\n",
    "2. If you run `eksctl version` in your Terminal window, you should get `version.Info{BuiltAt:\"\", GitCommit:\"\", GitTag:\"0.12.0\"}`. The `GitTag` should be `0.12.0`.\n",
    "    1. If you have already installed the `eksctl` tool previously, please update to the latest version so that your `GitTag` is `0.12.0`.\n",

    "## 1. Build a Docker image (no need to do this. Just notes for Bhaven)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now put our sentiment analysis Flask application into a Docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Let's create a Docker container for our Flask application.\n",
    "    1. Change directories into the `notebook_to_cloud/ml_deploy_demo/` directory.\n",
    "    2. Run `docker build -t <your_Dockerhub_username>/sentiment-analysis:latest -f Dockerfile .`\n",
    "    3. Run `docker image ls` to see that we created a new Docker image with the tag `server`.\n",
    "    4. Run `docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 <your_Dockerhub_username>/sentiment-analysis:latest /bin/bash ml_deploy_demo/run.sh`.\n",
    "        2. By using the `-p 5000:5000` flag, we expose port 8080 to the outside so our web page can be accessed.\n",
    "4. Use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) to hit the endpoint at http://0.0.0.0:5000/predict.\n",
    "    1. Please send a `POST` request to the URL above.\n",
    "    2. Click on the *Body* tab, change the selection to *raw*, and change the format from *Text* to *JSON*.\n",
    "    3. Enter the following code into the text area:\n",

    "5. Clean-up steps:\n",
    "    1. Stop your containers with `docker stop $(docker container ls -q)`. This may take a few seconds.\n",
    "    2. Delete your containers with `docker rm $(docker ps -aq)`. Beware, this will stop all containers you have running on your computer, so if you have containers running for other classes, you will have to remove the containers using the container IDs.\n",
    "    3. Use `docker rmi <IMAGE_ID>` to delete your images, if you would like to."
