"From Notebook to Cloud" Workshop
Session 1: From Notebook to Python

Keywords:
=========
Python scripting, Python performance

Prerequisite:
=============
1. Install Anaconda
2. Install Sublime Text or other user preferred text editor

Session outline:
================
1. Why is Python scripting better than notebook?
	+ Performance
	+ Easy dev process
	+ Lightweight
	+ Linear dev
	+ Version conntrol

2. Toy example
	+ A Colab notebook about plotting a function
	+ Demo how non-linear dev will break the code
	+ Ask participants to convert the notebook code into a Python script, then rerun it

3. Harder example
	+ Current suggestion: regenerative morphing module
	+ Show how long the notebook is, and convince participants the need for scripts
	+ Possibly can also show user the vectorization in Python boost up performance
	+ Time comparison of two modules, one with vectorization, one without

4. Wrap up
	+ Pros and cons about notebook
	+ Why it is good to work in text editor
	+ Link to the second session of the workshop
